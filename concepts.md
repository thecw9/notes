- Basic Concept:
  - Hyperparameter: Parameters that are fixed(don't change) during the training process.

- Machine Learning Classify
  - Parameteric learning: predictions for new inputs are based purely on the learned parameter vector w.

-Machine learning task
 - sentiment analysis

- Data preprocessing
  - data augmentation

- Hypothesis
  - model selection
    - pre-trained model
  - simplify model
    - parameter sharing

- Hoss function

- Optimization
